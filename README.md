Apoptosis Activation via Extrinsic and Intrinsic Pathways

Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is  highly regulated in multicellular organisms. Research has uncovered two common apoptotic pathways:the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway.However, the molecular mechanisms involved in both pathways are not yet fully understood. Simple (first order Runge-Kutta) deterministic simulation of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways were developed to study the sensitivity of the time to cell death to overexpression of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules in each pathway. 

Overall, results show that the completion time of apoptosis is more sensitive to overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 molecule and to the pro-apoptotic procaspase 9 molecule from the intrinsic pathway than to corresponding molecules from the extrinsic pathway. Results suggest that treatments for apoptosis dysfunction can be effective if the intrinsic pathway and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic molecules such as procaspases 8 and 9 are targeted.
